                                      Inspired by the treasure house of Shosoin, a registered World Heritage site, as the builder and the keeper of your personal storage room, we strive to be a professional in creating spaces. We believe that space does not equate to emptiness. We believe that space embraces people’s feeling and nurtures something new. We believe that by creating space, we present new value and broader possibility. We believe that with our experience and knowledge, we see essence of things we store and give new values to them. We believe the space nurtures heritage to be passed on to the next generation and visions for the future.

The tiny magnetic-field sensor and magnet in a box is our secret sauce for rapid prototyping electronics. Each single unit supports various functionalities, sufficiently powerful for replacing a drawer full of gadgets! You just need to plug the sensor to the Arduino and download the free software development kit, then everything works magically! The breadboard compatible design not only enable easy extensions, but also saving your soldering efforts! It is the ONE sensor for ALL.                                    </p>

The most prominent feature of our shop is that users participate in creative processes. Its style is unique in a way that users can share and discuss about the works while working directly with printers. This enables people with no prior experience to participate, and it even makes it possible for those professional designers and creators to be more challenging with their works by making the process hands-on.                                    </p>
